# NPM Commands Reference

This guide explains all available npm commands and when to use them.

## ⚡ **NEW - Ultimate Command** (v2.60.0)

### `npm run go` ⭐
**THE simplest way to run the bot** - Does EVERYTHING automatically!

```bash
npm install    # Install dependencies (first time only)
npm run go     # Does EVERYTHING else!
```

**What it does:**
1. ✅ Checks if Chromium browser is installed → Installs if missing
2. ✅ Checks if project is built (`dist/`) → Builds if missing
3. ✅ Starts the bot immediately

**When to use:**
- **First time setup** (after `npm install`)
- **After git pull** (ensures browser + build are ready)
- **Daily use** (simplest command)
- **When unsure** (it checks everything!)

## 🚀 Essential Commands

### `npm start`
**Start the bot** - Use this to run the Microsoft Rewards Bot after setup.

```bash
npm start
```

**What it does:**
- Runs the compiled JavaScript from `dist/index.js`
- Checks for automatic updates (if enabled)
- Executes reward earning tasks
- Fastest way to run the bot

**When to use:**
- Daily bot execution
- After setup is complete
- When you want to earn points

### `npm run setup`
**First-time installation** - Run this only once when setting up the project.

```bash
npm run setup
```

**What it does:**
1. Creates `accounts.jsonc` from template
2. Guides you through account configuration
3. Installs dependencies (`npm install`)
4. Builds TypeScript (`npm run build`)
5. Installs Playwright browsers

**When to use:**
- First time installing the bot
- After fresh git clone
- To reconfigure accounts

**Important:** This does NOT start the bot automatically. After setup, run `npm start`.

## 📝 Command Comparison

| Command | Speed | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `npm start` | ⚡ Fast | Run bot | Daily use |
| `npm run dev` | 🐌 Slow | Development | Code changes |
| `npm run build` | ⏱️ Medium | Compile TS | Before start |
| `npm run setup` | ⏱️ Medium | First install | Once only |

---

## Common Workflows

### First-Time Setup
```bash
# 1. Run setup wizard
npm run setup

# 2. Start the bot
npm start
```

### Daily Usage
```bash
npm start
```

### After Code Changes
```bash
# Method 1: Build then run (faster)
npm run build
npm start

# Method 2: Direct run (slower)
npm run dev
```

### After Pulling Updates
```bash
# If dependencies changed
npm install

# Rebuild
npm run build

# Start bot
npm start
```

### Troubleshooting
```bash
# Clean install

## ❓ FAQ

### Why does `npm run start` trigger updates?
The bot automatically checks for updates on startup (configurable in `config.jsonc`). To disable:
```jsonc
{
  "update": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

### What's the difference between `npm start` and `npm run start`?
**No functional difference** - both run the same command. `npm start` is a shorthand for `npm run start`.

### Should I use `npm start` or `npm run dev`?
- **Production/Daily use:** `npm start` (faster)
- **Development:** `npm run dev` (no build needed)

### How do I completely reset the project?
```bash
npm run clean
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json dist
npm run setup
```
